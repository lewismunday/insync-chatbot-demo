What is Directors and Officers Insurance? Directors and Officers Insurance, or D&O Insurance, provides personal\
liability protection for the directors and officers of a limited company. Personal claims can occur against\
individual directors, or all board members, where they have acted (or are accused of acting) without property\
authority, or have breached part of the Companies Act. As a director within a limited company, you are in the\
decision-making seat alongside other directors and management. As such, these individuals may be held personally\
responsible for certain losses. D&O cover can be purchased in isolation or as part of a comprehensive management\
liability policy which will include additional protection for Employment Practices Liability and entity cover for the\
business itself.\
Why do I need D&O and Business insurance? As one of the highest positions of power in a company, a director is often\
celebrated when the company is successful but also has to face scrutiny when things don’t go as planned.As such,\
as a director or officer, you have specific duties, responsibilities and powers associated with the position. If you\
are found to have acted outside of the job description or have appeared to be negligent, you may be faced with a\
civil, criminal or regulatory penalty.Due to the high-risk decisions by directors as individuals,  Director and\
Officer Insurance will protect you as an individual.Directors and Officers insurance can cover you against Breach of\
trustBreach of dutyNeglect or errorand many more. These are all cases which are not usually covered by standard\
Business Insurance. \
Do I need Directors and Officers Insurance? If you are a company director or an officer such as a company secretary,\
you have a personal responsibility and liability for your actions. Without adequate Directors and Officers Insurance,\
you could find yourself on the wrong end of costly litigation or compensation claims. Similarly, you could be subject\
to fines from shareholders, third parties or regulators such as the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). While\
accusations can later be disproven, without adequate insurance protection you would be left to manage the process and\
any associated costs independently. As such, D&O cover can protect your personal finances from these claims.\
