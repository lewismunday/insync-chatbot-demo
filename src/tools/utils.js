D&O cover can be purchased in isolation or as part of a comprehensive managementliability policy which will include additional protection for Employment Practices Liability and entity cover for thebusiness itself.Why do I need D&O and Business insurance?

If youare found to have acted outside of the job description or have appeared to be negligent, you may be faced with acivil, criminal or regulatory penalty.Due to the high-risk decisions by directors as individuals,  Director andOfficer Insurance will protect you as an individual.Directors and Officers insurance can cover you against Breach oftrustBreach of dutyNeglect or errorand many more.
